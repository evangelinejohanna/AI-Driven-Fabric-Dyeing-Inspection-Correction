AI-Based Fabric Dyeing Inspection & Correction

An intelligent fabric inspection system that leverages deep learning and computer vision to detect dyeing defects and suggest optimal corrections. This project aims to assist textile manufacturers in improving dyeing quality, minimizing fabric wastage, and automating inspection workflows.

Key Features

AI-Based Fabric Inspection Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (ResNet50) and OpenCV to detect dyeing defects directly from RGB images (no grayscale conversion).

Intelligent Dye Correction Analyzes detected dye inconsistencies and suggests optimal corrections based on historical defect data and patterns.

Manufacturer Decision Support Provides a comparison between the original and AI-corrected output, helping manufacturers make informed decisions and reduce fabric wastage.
